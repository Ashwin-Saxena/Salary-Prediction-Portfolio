# Salary Prediction Portfolio
Salary Prediction Project (Python)

## <u>Description</u>
The purpose of this project is to use data transformation and machine learning to create a model that will predict a salary when given years of experience, job type, college degree, college major, industry, and miles from a metropolis. 

## <u>Data</u>
The data for this model is fairly simplified as it has very few missing pieces. The raw data consists of a training dataset with the features listed above and their corresponding salaries. There is also a testing dataset that does not have any preexisting salary information available.

### <u>Information Used To Predict Salaries</u>
<ul>
  <li><b>Years Experience:</b> How many years of experience</li>
  <li><b>Job Type:</b> The position held (CEO, CFO, CTO, Vice President, Manager, Janitor, and senior or junior position)</li>
  <li><b>College Degree:</b> Doctoral, Masters, Bachelors, High School, or None</li>
  <li><b>College Major:</b> Biology, Business, Chemistry, Computer Science, Engineering, Literature, Math, Physics, or None</li>
  <li><b>Industry:</b> Auto, Education, Finance, Health, Oil, Service, or Web</li>
  <li><b>Miles From Metropolis:</b> How many miles away from a major city</li>
  </ul>
